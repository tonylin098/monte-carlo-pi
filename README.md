# monte-carlo-pi
Approximates the value of Pi by first having a circle
of radius r inside a square of length 2r and then randomly sampling
and counting the number of points that fall in the circle. Pi can then
be approximated by dividing the points in the circle by the total number
of points and multiplying by four.
